# Advice Generator Website


## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! Today, I am excited to share a fun and simple project that I recently worked on: an Advice Generator website. This project fetches random pieces of advice from an external API and displays them on a webpage. It's a great way to practice working with APIs and building interactive web applications.

## Project Overview

The Advice Generator website is a straightforward application that allows users to get random advice at the click of a button. It uses the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/advice) to fetch advice and display it on the webpage.

## Features

- **Fetches Advice**: Retrieves random advice from the Advice Slip API.
- **Displays Advice**: Shows the advice along with an advice number.
- **Interactive Button**: Users can fetch new advice by clicking a button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the API and updating the DOM.


## Installation

3. **Run the project**:
